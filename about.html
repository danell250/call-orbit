      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        “It all started with a simple observation: contact center teams were juggling too many dashboards, portals, and scattered analytics just to get a clear picture of their operations. Hours were wasted, insights were delayed, and frustration was high. That’s when the spark happened.<br><br>
        One late night, surrounded by sketches on a whiteboard and empty coffee cups, the idea of CallOrbit was born — a single platform that could manage multiple locations effortlessly, without compromising power or flexibility. We wanted something bold, intuitive, and a little bit magical.<br><br>
        Building it wasn’t easy. We tested, failed, and iterated. But each challenge only made the platform smarter, sleeker, and more capable. Today, CallOrbit empowers teams globally to see the big picture at a glance, make faster decisions, and run their operations like a well-orchestrated symphony.<br><br>
        This isn’t just software. It’s a revolution in contact center management — designed by people who understand the chaos, and built for teams who refuse to settle for the ordinary.”
